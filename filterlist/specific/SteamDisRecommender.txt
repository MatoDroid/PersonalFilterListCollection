! Thanks for the SimpleWall and neither ContextMenu Firewall apps that appear in Tweaking Software or EasyContextMenu, I've also
! block some shady steam EXEs that not necessary for my life anymore, include SteamServices, SteamWebHelper, SteamErrorReporter,
! etc. pluse those EXEs are ruined my precious notebook performance too much like a potato chips even I just run only the main
! steam client! I give no thanks for new UI and... FUCK THOSE EXPERIMENTAL LABS THAT MOSTLY DO TRACKING US FOR JUST OFFER
! PRECIOUSLY TARGETED AND IMPACT ZUCKESTIONS, AND WE CANNOT OPT OUT AT ANY WAY!!
! Now I've ended up to launch steam client without activating any browsers modules from it, anything that I need to do while
! playing games will ended to browsers (and sometime mobile app) only, include subscribe and managing workshop contents.
! Even I've also use android app that linked to personal account, but I will only use for workshop related functions, not for
! looking to other games and/or software through its apps unless I've open in the browsers that can install either uBlock0 or
! NanoAdblocker!!!
