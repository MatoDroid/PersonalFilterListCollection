# Issues: https://github.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/labels/Domain%20Lists%20and%20Wildcard
# Mirror: https://gitlab.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/raw/master/domains/pdnsf-additionalhosts.txt
# Description: This file will intent to only work with "personalDNSFilter" app for read additional hosts that aim for blocking
#              matched wildcard and entire domains regardless of any subdomains, unless you've manually unblocked or based on my
#              decision as enough reason for subjected to whitelist.
#              This filter is unlike generic hosts file and/or domain lists that you can update and/or recombine with, because
#              the targeted app are also support wildcard blocking, but this should be loaded as user custom hosts, however.
#              You may need to regularly copy and update this file with your own way, futhurmore, you need to backup previous
#              custom hosts list if you have anything existed before use this file as a replacement.
#              Since this filter cannot load as remote rules, if you think I've overdone blocking something, try add "!" or "#"
#              (w/o quote) to unblock or whitelist it manually, e.g. below.
#              !google.co.th (This is a whitelist rule, that's mean anything from 'google.co.th' can be bypassed, include subs)
#              #facebook.com (This will turn blocked rules as comment instead, other remote rules will still block if it have.)

# "Retard Logic" use the random subdomains of any website who use that things to make sure all ads are survived blocking!
# Did any site owners who use that service noticed it's had impact to their client-side and/or web server performance?
# Or it really doesn't cost much any harm at all!?

# I want to say sorry to anyone who use CloudFlare DNS resolvers, but it's just my opinion to block due to Firefox's wrong turn!
# e.g. Out-of-box config of Firefox use "TRR" resolvers (aka. DoH) from CloudFlare by default!

# More privacy enhanced for Firefox users, make sure you've disable their internal TRR first.

# Note that some domains are neccessary but it's also shady at a same time, e.g. "Google Play Store" use gvt1~gvt3 domains for
# updating apps, while use randomized subdomains for phoning home (contains "beacon" in hostname) during, you may need to
# whitelisted it's app manually, however, I prefer you to looking for "Aurora" or "Yalp" and whitelist those apps instead if
# you don't want to use their official store app for update anything about applications in your phone.*
# Futhurmore, Youtube also use 'redirector.gvt1.com' to redirect ad videos as well.
# * Note that some apps are check "Installation source" that it's actually come from "Play Store" or not, you may lost some
#   feature or you can't even use app if it's detected that you're not installed from desired source that they want!

# Blocking connection check mean "Google Play" cannot trigger app updates and/or downloads unless you've once allow it!
# However, it's may prevent some unexpected behaviour, such as update disabled system apps without intent, e.g.
# YouTube, Google Chrome, Google Play Store itself, etc. and especially Google Play Service, because every update will reset
# device admin state, e.g. "Find my device" and "Lock Screen Service"
# (even you've turned off already, but it will re-enable after update it or reboot! and it's no way for disable permanently!!)*
# * Unless your device was rooted or use another OS ROM that not ship with any G-APPS!!!
# Also, I don't want to use Chrome, but unfortunately, I cannot find any proper way to keep stop updating it without that method!
# Futhurmore, because "Android 6+" can foruce use Google Chrome as System WebView, it's likely impossible for disabling that!
# Unless you're running "Android 9" and install "Shelter" app, you need to create work profile by that, then "Freeze" Chrome and
# also "DON'T EVEN UNFREEZE AND/OR USE IT!" once you've done that, Android will pick default SystemWebView and you will unable to
# use Chrome as WebView anymore because not all profiles are enabled Chrome for ready to use as WebView!

# Facebook Zero Substances (aka. "Free Basics", wait, no! "Free BaZUCKS")
# Allow these connections below means they can use additional tricks for keep track you with old tech, such WAP and MSISDN!
# Plus, their system can easily to determine that it's really you! because the shame quality of WAP protocal and MSISDN header
# are ship with your mobile phone numbers and will be leaks to ANYONE who want to capture it!!
# - Obviously! How many bad reputation of privacy at Facebook right now!?
# - Some shady companies in my country are use those method above to resolve phone numbers via those headers and protocol for
#   silently subscribe garbage contents and/or simply charging additional costs in billing or deduct prepaid calling balance,
#   with or without anything sending right to your mobile phone! (by SMS, MMS, WAP Push, etc.)
# Even their Free Basics domains was blocked, they can still tracking you from the main and sub hosts with that methods as well!
# e.g. They will binding your "DATR" cookie with mobile carrier name that you're using, you can check with diagnostics page at
# https://m.facebook.com/diagnostics
# - Sometime it's neccessary for them to make sure that you're eligable to use it, or if you've previously agree to use that!!
