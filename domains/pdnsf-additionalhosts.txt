# Issues: https://github.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/labels/Domain%20Lists%20and%20Wildcard
# Mirror: https://gitlab.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/raw/master/domains/pdnsf-additionalhosts.txt
# Description: This file will intent to only work with "personalDNSFilter" app for read additional hosts that aim for blocking
#              matched wildcard and entire domains regardless of any subdomains, unless you've manually unblocked or based on my
#              decision as enough reason for subjected to whitelist.
#              This filter is unlike generic hosts file and/or domain lists that you can update and/or recombine with, because
#              the targeted app are also support wildcard blocking, but this should be loaded as user custom hosts however.
#              You may need to regularly copy and update this file with your own way, futhurmore, you need to backup previous
#              custom hosts list if you have any existed before use this file as a replacement.
#              Since this filter cannot load as remote rules, if you think I've overdone blocking something, try add "!" or "#"
#              (w/o quote) to unblock or whitelist it manually, e.g. below.
#              !google.co.th (This is a whitelist rule, that's mean anything from 'google.co.th' can be bypassed.)
#              #facebook.com (This will turn blocked rules as comment instead, other remote rules will still block if it have.)

# I want to say sorry to anyone who use CloudFlare DNS resolvers, but it's just my opinion to block due to Firefox's wrong turn!
# e.g. Out-of-box config of Firefox use "TRR" resolvers (aka. DoH) from CloudFlare by default!

# Note that some domains are neccessary but it's also shady at a same time, e.g. "Google Play Store" use gvt1~gvt3 domains for
# updating apps, while use randomized subdomains for phoning home (contains "beacon" in hostname) during, you may need to
# whitelisted it's app manually, however, I prefer you to looking for "Aurora" or "Yalp" and whitelist those apps instead if
# you don't want to use their official store app for update anything about applications in your phone.
# Futhurmore, Youtube also use 'redirector.gvt1.com' to redirect ad videos as well.
