# Description: This file will intent to only work with "personalDNSFilter" app for read additional hosts that aim for blocking
#              matched wildcard and entire domains regardless of any subdomains, unless you've manually unblocked or based on my
#              decision as enough reason for subjected to whitelist.
#              This filter is unlike generic hosts file and/or domain lists that you can update and/or recombine with, because
#              the targeted app are also support wildcard blocking, but this should be loaded as user custom hosts however.
#              You may need to regularly copy and update this file with your own way, futhurmore, you need to backup previous
#              custom hosts list if you have any existed before use this file as a replacement.

# Note that some domains are neccessary but it's also shady at a same time, e.g. "Google Play Store" use gvt1~gvt3 domains for
# updating apps, while use randomized subdomains for phoning home (aka. "beacon") during, you may need to whitelisted it's app
# manually, however, I prefer you to looking for "Aurora" or "Yalp" and whitelist those apps instead if you're not want to use
# their official store app for update anything about applications in your phone.
# Futhurmore, Youtube also use 'redirector.gvt1.com' to redirect ad videos as well.
